# Sorting-Searching-Algorithms
We can use these to understand the concepts of time complexity by comparing two algorithms that do the same things in different methods.

for comparison between algorithms, one of the best ways to choose a better one is time complexity, and to understand the concept of time complexity, take some time out and read the doc in the repo, that'll be enough!
